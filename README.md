# SpotiClone
This repository contains a Spotify clone built using React.js, which aims to replicate some of the core functionalities of the popular music streaming service, Spotify. 
It allows users to log in to their Spotify accounts and access their playlists. The application utilizes the Spotify API and requires a valid client ID obtained from the Spotify for Developers website for authentication. The project also uses Axios to handle API requests and Styled Components to style the UI.
